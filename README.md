## General Info
This is a collection of code I have written as small personal projects and wanted to share. Each file contains code for a specific task that I wanted to learn how to automate. 
They are the following:   
- Reserving an appointment on a website. The sort of appointments that are filled within seconds!
- Downloading PDFs from a **dynamic** website (so. many. clicks.)
- Checking product stock on a website

P.S: *Good knowledge of Selenium, HTML and websites in general is needed.*

## Disclaimer
Please note that this repository is given for educational purposes only. The illegal use of web crawling and web monitoring is strongly discouraged. If web crawling is needed for a site that isn't your own, it is highly encouraged to reach out to the website owners and ask for their express permission.

## Setup
To run this project, follow the steps below:
- Create a python virtual environment
- Clone the repository in the directory where the virtual environment folder is installed
- Install requirements from [requirements.txt](https://github.com/hhalaby/web-crawling-automation/blob/main/requirements.txt) file
- **Edit the code to your own needs**
- Import the relevant class from the three available classes. For example:
```from check_appointment import CheckAppointment```
- Use the available [commands](https://github.com/hhalaby/web-crawling-automation#Commands)

## Current Status
This is an initial commit to get the project rolling. It should be tailored to specific needs as it will most probably not work out of the box.

## Future Updates
- Easier User Interaction (maybe through GUI)
- Customizable commands

## Commands
The following table summarizes the most used commands:
